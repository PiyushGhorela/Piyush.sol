# MyToken Solidity Contract

Simple ERC20-like token contract in Solidity.

## Description

This Solidity contract, MyToken, implements basic functionalities for a token on the Ethereum blockchain. It includes features to mint new tokens and burn existing tokens, while maintaining a record of balances for each address. The contract initializes with a token name "Piyush", abbreviation "PG", and starts with zero tokens in circulation.

## Getting Started

### Executing program

To interact with this contract:

1. Use Remix, an online Solidity IDE, or your preferred development environment.
2. Deploy the `MyToken.sol` contract on an Ethereum development environment or testnet.
3. Interact with the deployed contract by minting tokens to addresses and burning tokens from addresses.

### Help

If you encounter issues related to gas fees or contract deployment, ensure your development environment is properly configured with testnet Ether.
